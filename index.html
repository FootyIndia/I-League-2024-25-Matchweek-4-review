        <h2><b>I-League 2024/25- Matchweek 4 Review</b></h2>
        <p class="author">09 Dec 2024 | Written by Shyam Sundar</p>
        <img class="cover" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeWRbDKWYAAk8Ob?format=jpg&name=large" alt="I-League">
        <p>
          The fourth match week of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-League">I-League</a> came to a close
          with Delhi FC's win over Sreenidi Deccan FC. Yes, you
          read it right. This was a gameweek of surprises with SC Bengaluru scoring three past Dempo SC, Rajasthan
          getting thrashed 8-0 by Shillong Lajong and Churchill stunning Gokulam Kerala at home. From SC Bengaluru's
          maiden victory to Sreenidi's missed chances, let's take a look at some of the key moments of the gameweek.
        </p>
        <h4><b>SC Bengaluru finally off the mark with win against Dempo </b></h4>
        <p>
          The first matchup was between two recently promoted teams; one had not won in three games, while the other had
          not suffered a defeat in their opening three games. Dempo had a fantastic start, earning seven points from
          three games while giving up no goals. SC Bengaluru, on the other hand, winless in the league so far upset the
          Goan side with a 3-1 victory to claim their maiden I-League victory. Krishananda Singh handed SC Bengaluru the
          lead in the first minute, taking only 40 seconds. Saiesh's incredible goal from a corner just before halftime
          gave Dempo the equalizer. However, the Bangalore team battled to the very end, sealing a 3-1 triumph and all
          three points with two late goals.
        </p>
        <img class="cover" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeX8wTPaMAAAWhB?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="SC Bengaluru">
        <p>
          This was SC Bengaluru's first win of the season. A goal for Salam Johnson Singh would boost his confidence, as
          he has dealt with injuries lately. Given how they had begun the season, Dempo's loss would disappoint Samir
          Naik. The Dempo defense, which includes Ashish Sibi, who has had an outstanding in the I-League thus far,
          appeared
          susceptible. Dempo would like to improve their performance in their next match against Sreenidi Deccan, while
          SC Bengaluru would like to capitalize on this victory in their next match versus Delhi FC.
        </p>
        <h4><b>Churchill Brother stun Gokulam Kerala at home </b></h4>
        <p>
          Gokulam Kerala hosted Churchill Brothers at home in the second game of the week. Churchill, fresh off a 3-1
          triumph against SC Bengaluru, secured another victory by defeating the Malabarians. Shibinraj, the opposition
          keeper, had little chance when local boy Stendly Fernandes scored the game's only goal with a tremendous
          strike. There were a few chances for both teams to score, but both goalkeepers made some outstanding saves to
          keep the score line intact.
        </p>
        <img class="cover" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeM80oEbwAI-CFF?format=jpg&name=large"
          alt="Churchill Brothers">
        <p>
          Despite starting the 2024/25 I-League with a victory over Sreenidi Deccan, Gokulam Kerala has struggled since
          then. With
          just five points from four games and no clean sheets, Antonio Rueda's team is currently in sixth place after
          two draws and a loss in their past three games. Churchill's fortunes are improving, as the club has won two
          consecutive games. Their next match is away from home against a formidable Inter Kashi team, while Gokulam
          will be traveling to Shillong.
        </p>
        <h4><b>Cledson's hattrick ensures Namdhari all three points </b></h4>
        <p>
          The third game of the week featured an unbeaten Aizawl FC against a winless Namdhari FC. Namdhari won their
          first game of the season at home, defeating Aizawl FC 3-1 thanks to Cledson's hat trick. Manvir Singh's shot
          off the woodwork was superbly collected and finished by Cledson, giving Namdhari the lead. Cledson doubled the
          lead a few minutes later with another fantastic right-footed goal from outside the penalty box. Aizawl came
          out strong in the second half, but were unable to break Namdhari's defense. Cledson completed his hat-trick
          with another goal from outside the area, guaranteeing Namdhari the three points.
        </p>
        <img class="cover" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeR-85RbUAA7dWf?format=jpg&name=large" alt="Namdhari FC">
        <p>
          Lalrinfela pulled one back for Aizawl, but it wasn't enough as the hosts won 3-1. David Capobianco would be
          overjoyed to achieve the season's first victory after being winless in the first three games. Given their
          early goal-scoring difficulties, he would be overjoyed to see his striker score a hat-trick. The outcome,
          however, will frustrate Aizawl, who had a fantastic chance to defeat a comparatively weak opponent before
          playing the next three games at home.
        </p>
        <h4><b>Shillong thrash Rajasthan United 8-0 </b></h4>
        <p>
          Shillong Lajong hosted Rajasthan United FC in the fourth match of the week. The hosts gave the visitors no
          chance as they smashed them 8-0. Three minutes into the match, Shillong took the lead thanks to Figo's goal.
          Brazilian striker Douglas doubled the lead before Daniel extended it shortly prior to halftime. Despite having
          a 3-0 lead going into the second half, Shillong continued to score five more goals, including two own goals.
          Among the Shillong players, Imanol Arona had an outstanding outing, contributing two assists and scoring one
          goal.
        </p>
        <img class="cover" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeWRbDLXMAAeQa3?format=jpg&name=large"
          alt="Shillong Lajong">
        <p>
          By signing some very important foreign players, Rajasthan United created quite a stir during the transfer
          window. But Walter Caprile's team is struggling; they have only won one of their four games in I-League
          2024/25 and have
          given up 13 goals in those four games, putting them at the bottom of the league. Shillong, on the other hand,
          won their first game of the season after two draws in their opening three games. They will feel quite
          confident going into their next match against Gokulam Kerala.
        </p>
        <h4><b>Table toppers settle for a draw </b></h4>
        <p>
          Real Kashmir hosted Antonio Lopez Habbas' Inter Kashi at home in the fifth game of the week. Both teams were
          undefeated coming into the match, having won two and drawn one in their three games in the 2024/25 I-League
          thus far.
          Ramsanga's
          bullet header from the far post from a corner gave the Snow Leapords the lead early on. Despite having a few
          chances to tie the score, Inter Kashi was unable to get past Real Kashmir's strong defense. Domi Berlanga
          equalized for Inter Kashi, who now has four goals in four games this season. Even though both teams had a few
          chances in the final minutes of the game, the final score was 1-1.
        </p>
        <img class="cover" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Geatkr7WUAArhX_?format=jpg&name=4096x4096"
          alt="Real Kashmir">
        <p>
          Habbas will be worried about his team's goal-scoring struggles, but a point away from home against an
          excellent Real Kashmir team is always a positive result. They have only managed to score two goals in their
          last four games, even though they scored five goals against Delhi FC. With two difficult matches against
          Churchill and Sreenidi looming, Habbas would like to see his team score more goals. Ishfaq Ahmed's home run
          has come to an end, and they will play three straight away games. It was difficult for the Snow Leopards to
          get results away from home last year, and Ishfaq would like to see that alter this season.
        </p>
        <h4><b>Sreenidi miss oppurtunity to go top of table </b></h4>
        <p>
          Sreenidi Deccan hosted Delhi FC at the Deccan Arena in the game week's last match. Sreenidi Deccan was the
          clear favorite to win the match because Delhi FC had only one point from their last three games. However,
          Delhi FC managed to defeat Sreenidi Deccan by a slim 1-0 margin, earning all three points. The game's lone
          goal, scored by Stéphane Binong, gave Delhi FC all three points.
        </p>
        <img class="cover" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GeXC97yaQAAvUrU?format=jpg&name=4096x4096" alt="Delhi FC">
        <p>
          Sreenidi had a genuine chance to get three points and climb to the top of the table after Real Kashmir and
          Inter Kashi dropped points at the top of the table, but Rui Amorim's team wasted this fantastic opportunity.
          Regarding Delhi FC, they would be quite happy to start the season. Before facing SC Bengaluru, a victory over
          a better team, such as Sreenidi, will boost confidence.
